## Project Description 'Sandvas'
Our goal with this project was to create a sand-art simulation game where the player attempts to match an AI-generated pattern by dropping sand into a jar to create patterns.
The GenAI levels could be generated in a more custom fashion with user prompts. We plan to implement a MongoDB Atlas account database system so that users can login and save their game data or art pieces. This could be further expanded upon by implementing a social media-like network where users could post their own art pieces and enjoy others.

## User Manual
The game begins in the main menu, which then directs you to the level generation scene.
